## Creating a grow zone
A grow zone is supposed to map a grow area with lights and a height above the canopy. 
Press the grow zone  button at the top left and press "+ New grow zone" to start creating a new grow zone.
Drag the lights you want to be in this zone over, and select your spacing and height above canopy. 
Then press save.

You can press the small lightbulb icon with an arrow over it to create a light cycle to output in this grow zone.
